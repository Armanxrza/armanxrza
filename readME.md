## About Me

I am a **security thinker with a bias for action**, operating at the intersection of **resilience, responsibility, and resourceful problem-solving**.

My work focuses on translating **complex cybersecurity challenges into grounded, human-centered solutions** — protecting *people first* and *systems second*. I bring a disciplined analytical mindset paired with **empathy, intentional communication, and long-term vision**.

Whether advising institutions, empowering youth, or contributing to community-led initiatives, I work to **build clarity in chaos** and elevate collective digital safety.

> Continuously evolving.
